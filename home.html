	   Chess Rules:</br></br>
	   
Limit of number of players:</br></br>
Classical: 5(4+1 reserve)</br>
Lightning: 5(4+1 reserve)</br></br>
General chess rules:</br>
1)	All FIDE chess rules apply as on January 1st ,2010.</br>
2)	Touch to move: If a player touches a piece, he/she must move it. It also requires him/her to capture opponents' piece if he/she touches it. This rule only applies if the player can make a legal move with the piece touched. If a player accidentally brushes a piece he/she is not required to move it. If a player touches a piece by non-playing area (like elbow), then he is not required to move the piece. If a piece is awkwardly placed then you can adjust it; simply say “I adjust” before touching the piece to make it clear to the opponent that you do not intend to move it</br>
3)	Clock rules: Opponents must press the clock with the same hand that he moves the pieces. If not he/she may be penalized one minute, which will be added to the opponent’s time. The chess clock will be placed on black’s right hand side.</br>
4)	Illegal move: If one player makes an illegal move, while playing on the clock, two minutes will be added to the opponent’s time. The player also must move the piece that he touched, if legal.</br>
5)	Winning on time: Whichever player’s flag falls first, loses the game (on time). To claim a win on time, stop both clocks-claimants flag must be still standing and he/she must have winning material. If both the flags are down, then the game is drawn.</br>
6)	Rules of draw:</br>
Draw by offer: A proposal of draw must be made after a move and before pressing the clock. (make the offer of draw while the claimant’s clock is running) the opponent might accept it or reject it. Any opponent who makes an improper draw offer may be penalized one minute added to the opponent’s time</br>
Draw by threefold repetition: The claimant must present a score sheet demonstrating that the same position: A) is about to occur or B) has occurred with the same player to move. It must be the claimant’s move to make such a claim. If the claimant makes a move and stop the clock, the claim will be considered invalid.</br>
50 move rule: If a player shows that (with moves written on score sheet) 50 moves have been made without a pawn being moved or any capture made, then he/she may claim the game a draw. Both the clocks should be stopped before claiming for a draw</br>
Stalemate: If the player on turn has no legal move but it is not on check, this is stalemate and the game is a draw</br>
Impossibility of checkmate: If the position arises in which neither of the players could possibly give a checkmate by a series of legal moves, the game is a draw. This is usually because there is insufficient material left.</br>
TOUNAMENT RULES AND INFORMATION:</br>
1)	The board order of players should be given beforehand to the committee. It cannot be changed except as per the substitution rule</br>
2)	In case of a 2-2 draw between the playing teams in critical rounds, three blitz matches will be played between the best players of each team. The captains of both teams will report the names of the best player to the organizer confidentially. In case of further draw,  a final Armageddon match will be held</br>
3)	Rule for substitution: “Roll over substitution”</br>
The boards lower to the board on which substitution is made would slide one board till the board of substitution </br>
Example 1: Assume following the board order A-1,B-2,C-3,D-4. Substitute player E. In that case, the player A (on board 1) is to be substituted. New board order would be B-1, C-2, D-3, E-4. (Non-playing A)</br>
Example 2: Assume the board order A-1, B-2, C-3,D-4. Substitute player E. In case player C is to be substituted (on board 3), then the new board order would be A-1,B-2,D-3,E-4.</br>
Violation of these rules would lead to ‘0-4’ loss to the violating team for that round.</br>
4)	Contact the organizers to clear your confusion/dispute. If a player has a disagreement he/she should stop the clock, contact an arbiter and ask for a solution. The chess clock should be stopped before calling an organizer</br>
5)	All participating teams are requested to bring ‘chess clocks’. The player is required to know how to use a clock. A player may ask about its operation before the clocks are applied.</br>
6)	It is expected that players record the moves. (sheet will be provided) It may help to resolve some disputes. At the end of each game, a signed copy (by both players) of result sheet should be handed over to the organizers. The moves should be written in standard chess notation.</br>
7)	NO PROMPTING IS ALLOWED. (even if violation of any rule is noticed by spectators) Any person found guilty of prompting will be disqualified and strict action would be taken against the team to which he/she belongs.</br>
8)	A player or his/her team can be disqualified if his/her conduct in the tournament  hall is not found satisfactory</br>
9)	After the game is over, the players should leave the table immediately, However, the captains of the playing teams can stay inside the playing arena even if his/her match is over.</br>
10)	Walkover would be given to the player if his/her opponent doesn’t turn up in 30 minutes (for classical chess) after the round has started. Any player absent from the playing room or board for more than fifteen minutes without permission from the committee may have his/her game forfeited due to unsportsmanlike conduct </br>
11)	Please switch off your mobiles of keep it in silent mode. Everyone present in the hall is expected to maintain silence. Violating team will likely be subject to a penalty, and even may have to forfeit their game</br>
12)	Parents, coaches, managers are not allowed inside the playing arena.</br>
RULES SPECIFIC TO LIGHTNING CHESS:</br>
1)	Time of game will be 5 minutes to each player per game</br>
2)	Illegal move pointed out by the opponent immediately results in a loss</br>
3)	Players don’t need to point out a check to the opponent</br>
RULES SPECIFIC TO ANTI CHESS</br>
The rules are those for standard chess, except for the following special rules:</br>
1)	Capturing is compulsory.</br>
2)	When more than one capture is available, the player may choose.</br>
3)	The king has no royal power and accordingly:</br>
#	It may be captured like any other piece.</br>
 #There is no check or checkmate.</br>
 #There is no castling.</br>
	#A pawn may promote also to king.</br>
4)	Stalemate is a win for stalemated player.</br>
A player wins by losing all his pieces, or being stalemated. Apart from move repetition, draw by agreement, and the fifty-move rule, the game is also drawn when a win is impossible (such as if a dark-squared bishop and a light –squared bishop are the only pieces remaining).</br>
